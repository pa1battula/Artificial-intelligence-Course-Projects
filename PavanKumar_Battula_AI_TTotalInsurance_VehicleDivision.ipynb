The Age Variable contains a group of 0 (zero) values that either need to be cleaned up or the rows discarded.

Normalize ALL NUMERIC features**\n","**Why do we need to normalize?**\n","Remember when we hot-encoded the categorical variables? That's when we translated all categories into either 0 or 1. If one variable has a much larger scale than the others, it can dominate the learning process and overshadow the importance of other features. It's like studying for a test where one chapter is ten times longer than the others – you might end up focusing too much on that chapter and missing out on important information from the others.\n","\n","To level the playing field and ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process, we normalize them. Normalization scales all features to a similar range, typically between 0 and 1 or with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This way, each feature's contribution is balanced, and the neural network can learn more effectively from all the data.\n","\n","There are different ways of normalizing data. One way is to do the math manually as you have seen in the previous week's file. Another way is to use the [**preprocessing.Normalization layer**](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/numerical/normalization/).
