Building the Model**\n","There is always a specific process with which to build a TensorFlow model:\n","<div>\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shstreuber/Data-Mining/master/images/TF_Process2.png\" width=\"600\">\n","</div>\n","\n","1. First, we set up the **keras SEQUENTIAL MODEL**. This is the framework inside of which we are going to define the layers. Sequential = layers are sequentially next to each other (either “stacked” or left-to-right, depending on how you draw them).\n","---\n","2. Inside the Sequential model, we define the **LAYERS**. To do this, we need to know the following:\n","* **Normalization Layer**: If used, this is usually the first layer when input data needs to be normalized.\n","* **Shape**: This is the number of attributes we use as input for the model.\n","We need to ensure that the input layer has the correct number of input features. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the input_shape argument.\n","---\n","3. In the next step, we define HOW we want the model to run, that is to **COMPILE**, with model.compile(). To do this, we need to know the following:\n","* **Optimizer** = gradient descent function (i.e. which function we use to optimize the step-down of the weights); adam = adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm\n","* **Loss Function**= evaluation of the ŷ vs the ground truth\n","* **Metrics** = evaluation criterion, typically accuracy.\n","---\n","4. Then, we **FIT** the model to the training set with model.fit(). To do this, we need to know the following:\n","* **Epoch**: One Epoch is when an ENTIRE dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network only ONCE. If one epoch is too big to feed to the computer at once we can divide it in several smaller batches\n","* **Batch size**: Depending on the number of needed features in your dataset (you should reduce these to NO MORE THAN 6), the computing effort can be too intense. Just like you would not each a whole sandwich in one bite, the machine does better when processing the data in smaller bites called batches. The standard batch size is 32.\n","---\n","5. Lastly, we use our model to **PREDICT** the values for the test set with model.predict()\n","---\n","**How we choose the LOSS FUNCTION** for step 3 depends on the type of calculation we need our Neural Network to perform:\n","* If the output variable is **continuous**, we are performing a regression, so the loss function is **mean squared error or MSE**\n","* If the output variable is **binary**, we are performing a classification, so the loss function is **binary_crossentropy**\n","* If the output variable is **categorical** with more than two labels, we are still performing a classification, but now the loss function is **categorical_crossentropy**\n","\n","**How we choose the ACTIVATION FUNCTION** when defining the layers: It used to be the case that Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is achieved using the  [relu function](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning). Using a sigmoid on the output layer ensures your network output is between 0 and 1 and is easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5.\n","\n","**How we choose the NUMBER AND SIZE OF LAYERS**:\n","\n","The short answer is: We experiment until we get the best output the fastest. The longer answer is: We can use various optimization strategies that can help us out somewhat. So, let's assume that trial and error has shown us that three layers is optimal. Furthermore, let's assume that we are going to build a Dense Network, aka a fully connected network structure, in which every node is connected with every node in the next layer.\n","\n","To define this architecture, we will specify the number of neurons or nodes in the layer as the first argument, and set up the activation function with the activation argument.\n","\n","As activation function, we will use the rectified linear unit or ReLU activation function on the first two layers and the [the sigmoid function ](https://towardsdatascience.com/sigmoid-and-softmax-functions-in-5-minutes-f516c80ea1f9) in the output layer since our output is binary.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"H0ASsd3aQ5F6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**3.1 Defining the keras model**\n","We will build our model as follows:\n","1.
